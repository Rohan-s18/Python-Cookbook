# Qiskit
## Author: Rohan Singh and Rachel Tjarksen
This directory contains source code for different Quantum Computing Projects that use IBM's Qiskit Library for Python. I'm currently writing an intro to Quantum Computing paper on ArXiv that you can use as a pre-requisite to understand the basics of Quantum Computing, such as the linear algebra, qubits and the gates, so that you can better understand what's going on.  

## Setup
To set up Qiskit on your Python Env or Venv, you will need to install the Qiskit library using PIP, you will additionally need Numpy and Matplotlib.  

To install Qiskit, use the following command on your machine:  
  > pip install qiskit
