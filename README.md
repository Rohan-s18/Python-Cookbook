# Python Cookbook
## Author: Rachel Tjarksen and Rohan Singh
Python Repository made by Rohan Singh and Rachel Tjarksen. In this repository, we will be making projects using various different Python libraries, like Scikit-learn, Plotly, Qiskit, OpenCV, Tensorflow, Keras, Matplotlib, Django, Numpy, Dash etcetera.  

Through the projects of this repository, you will be able to learn how to use some of the cool libraries that make Python such a cool language.   

## Structure
This repository is structured into directories that specialize in the different Python libraries, those directories (for the libraries) are further divided into directories which contain projects of differing levels of difficulty.  

The directories for the libraries are:  
  - **Qiskit:** This directory contains source code for Python's Qiskit Library for Quantum Computing.  
  - **OpenCV:** This directory contains source code for Python's OpenCV library for Computer Vision.  
  - **Plotly:** This directory contains source code for Python's Plotly express library.  
  - **Scikit-Learn:** This directory contains source code for Pyhton's Scikit-learn Machine Learning Library.   
  - **Numpy:** This directory contains code for the linear algebra related stuff using Numpy.  
  - **PubChemPy:** This directory contains code for basic PubChemPy related stuff in Python (for Bio/Cheminformatics).
